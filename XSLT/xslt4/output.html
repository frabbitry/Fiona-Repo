   <body>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="character Agood">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</span> was
         assassinated</span> and <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span>
         was destroyed</span>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
      down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.<span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="faction Aevil">assassins</span> first attacked the
         <span class="character Agood">Emperor</span></span> in the
      <span class="location">White Gold Tower</span>. While the <span class="faction Agood">Blades</span> held <span class="faction Aevil">them</span> back,
      <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="character Agood">Emperor</span> made <span class="character Agood">his</span> way down to the
         <span class="location">dungeons</span></span>, to a <span class="location">secret escape
         route</span> built into <span class="location">one of the prison cells</span>. For
      reasons known only to <span class="character Agood">himself</span>, the <span class="character Agood">Emperor</span>
      <span class="QuestEvent">pardoned the fortunate <span class="character Aneutral">prisoner</span></span> in that <span class="location">cell</span>. Some say the
      <span class="character Aneutral">prisoner</span> reminded <span class="character Agood">him</span> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a <span class="QuestEvent">moment of
         prophecy</span>. Whatever the case, the <span class="character Aneutral">prisoner</span> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
      <span class="location">Empire</span> and <span class="location">Tamriel</span> - surely a sign that
      the gods themselves were at work.The pursuing <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="faction Aevil">assassins</span> killed the
         <span class="faction Agood">Blades</span> bodyguards</span> in a relentless
      series of sneak attacks. Eventually <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="faction Aevil">they</span>
         struck down the <span class="character Agood">Emperor</span>
         <span class="character Agood">himself</span></span>. Before <span class="character Agood">he</span> fell, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Agood">Uriel Septim VII</span> gave the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span> to
         the <span class="character Aneutral">prisoner</span></span>, who somehow
      <span class="QuestEvent">made it out of the <span class="location">Imperial sewers</span></span> and
      into the light of day.The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of <span class="faction Aevil">daedric cultists</span> known as the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic Dawn</span>. (Those who still suspect the <span class="faction Aneutral">Dark Brotherhood</span> should consider two facts: first, they would have only
      needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the <span class="faction Aneutral">Dark Brotherhood</span> would never be so foolish as to
      <span class="QuestEvent">effectively declare war on the Empire</span> and thus ensure their
      complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic
         Dawn</span>.)The <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span> next surfaced at <span class="location">Weynon
         Priory</span> near <span class="location">Chorrol</span>. <span class="character Agood">Jauffre</span>, secret <span class="epithet">Grandmaster of the
         <span class="faction Agood">Blades</span></span> and head of the
      <span class="location">priory</span>, <span class="QuestEvent">took possession of the
         <span class="QuestItem">amulet</span></span>. <span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="character Aneutral">messenger</span> was sent off to <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> to find a lowly <span class="character Agood">priest</span> named <span class="character Agood">Martin</span>.
      Unbeknownst even to <span class="character Agood">himself</span>, <span class="character Agood">Martin</span> was the bastard son of <span class="character Agood">Uriel Septim VII</span>, and the last heir to the Ruby
      Throne. <span class="character Agood">He</span> alone could use the
      <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span> to light the Dragonfires that wards the
      barrier between <span class="location">Tamriel</span> and <span class="location">Oblivion</span>, and save
      the world from the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic Dawn</span> plot.<span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="character Aneutral">prisoner</span> arrived at <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> to find <span class="location">it</span> overrun by <span class="faction Aevil">daedra</span> that had poured in
      from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of
      the
      Oblivion Crisis. How <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="character Aneutral">prisoner</span> closed
         the gate</span> is not recorded. Once closed, <span class="character Agood">Martin</span> and the surviving <span class="location">Kvatch</span>
      <span class="faction Agood">guardsmen</span> drove back the <span class="faction Aevil">daedra</span>.Now known as the <span class="epithet">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span>, <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="character Aneutral">prisoner</span> and <span class="character Agood">Martin</span>
         returned to <span class="location">Weynon Priory</span></span>, only to find the
      <span class="location">priory</span> sacked and the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span> taken.
      <span class="character Agood">Jauffre</span> survived the attack, however, and
      <span class="QuestEvent">the three of them
         made their way to <span class="location">Cloud Ruler Temple</span></span>, bastion of
      the <span class="faction Agood">Blades</span>. This secret <span class="location">fortress</span> in
      the <span class="location">mountains</span> outside <span class="location">Bruma</span> is
      where <span class="character Agood">Martin</span> was held safe while
      <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="epithet">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> searched for the lost
         <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span></span>.Knowing only that a mysterious group called the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic
         Dawn</span> was behind the <span class="QuestEvent">assassination and theft of the
         <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span></span>, <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="epithet">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> was sent to locate
         the <span class="faction Aevil">cult</span></span>. With the help of
      Baurus, a <span class="faction Agood">Blade</span> in the
      service of the <span class="character Agood">Emperor</span>, they somehow <span class="QuestEvent">used the
         <span class="QuestItem">Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes</span></span>,
      esoteric works by the madman <span class="character Aevil">Mankar Camoran</span>,
      to direct them to the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic Dawn</span>'s secret <span class="location">lair</span>. Scholars
      familiar with the <span class="QuestItem">Commentaries</span> claim the location is not directly
      mentioned in <span class="QuestItem">them</span>. How they did this remains a mystery.No official records exist of how <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="epithet">Hero of
            <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> penetrated the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic Dawn</span>'s <span class="location">lair</span></span>
      near <span class="location">Lake Arrius</span>. There is a bardic tale that claims the <span class="character Aneutral">Hero</span> used <span class="QuestEvent">trickery and disguise</span>, but
      that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <span class="character Aevil">Mankar Camoran</span> was behind the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic Dawn</span>, and that the <span class="faction Aevil">group</span> worshiped the daedric prince <span class="character Aevil">Mehrunes Dagon</span>. <span class="character Aevil">Mankar
         Camoran</span> believed <span class="character Aevil">himself</span> to
      be a direct descendant of the Camoran Usurper, the infamous
      pretender to the throne of <span class="location">Valenwood</span>.Somehow <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="character Aneutral">Hero</span> escaped with the
         <span class="QuestItem">Mysterium Xarxes itself</span></span>, the holy book of
      the <span class="faction Aevil">Mythic Dawn cult</span>. <span class="character Aevil">Mankar Camoran</span> fled to <span class="location">Oblivion</span> with the
      <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span>. With some effort and great risk to
      <span class="character Agood">his</span> sanity, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Agood">Martin</span> deciphered the Mysterium
         Xarxes</span> and intended to use <span class="QuestItem">it</span> to open a gateway
      to <span class="character Aevil">Mankar Camoran</span> in order to recover the
      <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span>.Before <span class="character Agood">Martin</span> could perform the ritual
      to open the gateway, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Aevil">Mehrunes
            Dagon</span> opened an Oblivion Gate outside <span class="location">Bruma</span></span>. <span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="epithet">Hero of
            <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> saved the <span class="location">city</span> and <span class="character Agood">Martin</span>
         by entering the gate and closing it</span> before a <span class="faction Aevil">daedric siege engine</span> could destroy <span class="location">Bruma</span>
      and <span class="location">Cloud Ruler Temple</span>. Many songs and stories have been told of
      this battle and I will not retell them here. The <span class="epithet">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> was now also known as the <span class="epithet">Savior of <span class="location">Bruma</span></span>.With the <span class="location">city</span> and <span class="location">Cloud Ruler
         Temple</span> safe, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Agood">Martin</span>
         opened the portal to <span class="character Aevil">Mankar Camoran</span>'s
         "<span class="location">Paradise</span>"</span>. The details of what transpired in
      this <span class="location">place</span> have not been recorded. All that is known is that
      <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="epithet">Savior of <span class="location">Bruma</span></span> travelled to this <span class="location">Paradise</span>,
         killed <span class="character Aevil">Mankar Camoran</span>, and returned with
         the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span></span>.With the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span> in hand, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Agood">Martin Septim</span> presented <span class="character Agood">himself</span> to the <span class="faction Agood">Elder
            Council</span> to be crowned <span class="epithet">Emperor of all
            <span class="location">Tamriel</span></span></span>. Once crowned <span class="character Agood">he</span> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
      <span class="location">Tamriel</span> from <span class="location">Oblivion</span>. In a last-ditch
      attempt to stop <span class="character Agood">him</span>, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Aevil">Mehrunes Dagon</span> launched an assault on the
         <span class="location">Imperial City</span>, opening several Oblivion Gates
         within the <span class="location">capital</span> itself</span>. Uncrowned,
      <span class="character Agood">Martin</span> joined the battle in the <span class="location">city streets</span>.<span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Aevil">Mehrunes Dagon himself</span>
         left <span class="location">Oblivion</span> and entered
         <span class="location">Tamriel</span></span>, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
      Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder,
      it was
      too late to relighting the Fires. <span class="character Agood">Martin
         Septim</span> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Agood">he</span> shattered the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of
            Kings</span> to become the <span class="character Agood">avatar of the god
            Akatosh</span> and do battle with <span class="character Aevil">Mehrunes
            Dagon</span></span>.Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
      <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="character Aevil">Mehrunes Dagon</span> was
         defeated and sent back to <span class="location">Oblivion</span></span>.
      <span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="character Agood">avatar of Akatosh</span> was
         turned to stone</span> and can be seen to this day in the <span class="location">Temple of
         the One</span> in the <span class="location">Imperial City</span>. With the
      <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span> gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
      Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to <span class="location">Oblivion</span> is sealed
      forever.
