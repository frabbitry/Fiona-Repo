         Poem 4 (J 241: 1861/1890)
         
         I like a look of Agony,
         Because I know it's true—
         Men do not sham Convulsion,
         Nor simulate a Throe—
         
         
         
         
         Death comes
         
         
         The Eyes glaze once—and—that is Death—
         Impossible to feign
         The Beads upon the Forehead
         By homely Anguish strung.
         
         
         
         Poem 1 (J 327: 1862/1891)
         
         Before I got my eye put out—
         I liked as well to see
         As other Creatures, that have Eyes—
         And know no other way—
         
         
         But were it told to me, Today,
         That I might have the Sky
         For mine, I tell you that my Heart
         Would split, for size of me—
         
         
         The Meadows—mine—
         The Mountains—mine— 
         All Forests—Stintless Stars—
         As much of noon, as I could take—
         Between my finite Eyes—
         
         
         The Motions of the Dipping Birds—
         The 
         Lightning's jointed Road—
         Morning's Amber Road—
         
         
         For mine—to look at when I liked 
         The news would strike me dead—
         
         
         So safer—guess—with just my soul
         Upon the window pane
         Where other Creatures put their Eyes
         Incautious of the Sun—
         
         
         Poem 9 (J 445: 1862/1896)
         
         
         'Twas just this time, last year, I died.
          I know I heard the Corn,
         When I was carried by the Farms—
         It had the Tassels on—
         
         
         I thought how yellow it would look—
         When Richard went to mill—
         And then, I wanted to get out,
         But something held my will.
         
         
         I thought just how red—Apples wedged
         The Stubble's joints between—
         And carts stooping round the fields
         To take the Pumpkins in—
         
         
         I wondered which would miss me, least,
         And when Thanksgiving, came,
         If father'd multiply the plates—
         To make an even Sum—
         
         
         And would it blur the Christmas glee
         My Stocking hand too high
         For any Santa Claus to reach
         The Altitude of me—
         
         
         But this sort, grieved myself,
         And so, I thought the other way,
         And just this time, some perfect year—
         Themself, should come to me—
         
         
         Poem 6 (J 281: 1861/1935)
         
         'Tis so appalling—it exhilarates— 
         
         
         So over Horror, it half Captivates—
         So over Horror, it dumb fascinates—
         
         
         The Soul stares after it, secure— 
         
         
         To know the worst, leaves no dread more—
         A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more—
         
         
         
         
         To scan a Ghost, is faint— 
         But grappling, conquers it— 
         How easy Torment, now— 
         Suspense kept sawing so— 
         
         
         The Truth, is Bald, and Cold— 
         But that will hold— 
         If any are not sure— 
         We show them—prayer— 
         But we, who know, 
         Stop hoping, now— 
         
         
         Looking at Death, is Dying— 
         Just let go the Breath— 
         And not the pillow at your Cheek 
         So Slumbereth— 
         
         
         Others, Can wrestle— 
         Yours, is done— 
         And so of Woe, bleak dreaded—come, 
         It sets the Fright at liberty— 
         And Terror's free— 
         Gay, Ghastly, Holiday! 
         
         
         Poem 7. (J 282: 1861/1929)
         
         How noteless Men and Pleiads, stand,
         Until a sudden sky
         Reveals the fact that One is rapt
         Forever from the Eye—
         
         
         Members of the Invisible,
         Existing while we stare,
         In Leagueless Opportunity,
         O'ertakeless, as the Air—
         
         
         Why didn't we 
         detain Them?
         retain Them?
         detain it?
         
         
         The Heavens with a smile,
         Sweep by our disappointed Heads
         
         Without a syllable—
         But deign no syllable
         
         
         
         
         Poem 5 (J 280: 1861/1896)
         
         I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, 
         And Mourners to and fro 
         Kept treading—treading—till it seemed 
         That Sense was breaking through— 
         
         
         And when they were all seated, 
         A Service, like a Drum— 
         Kept beating—beating—till I thought 
         My Mind was going numb— 
         
         
         And then I heard them lift a Box 
         And creak across my Soul 
         With those same Boots of lead, again, 
         Then Space began to toll, 
         
         
         As all the Heavens were a Bell, 
         And Being, but an Ear, 
         And I, and Silence, some strange Race 
         Wrecked, solitary, here— 
         
         
         And then a Plank in Reason, broke, 
         And I dropped down, and down— 
         And hit a World, at every 
         plunge,
         Crash—
         
         
         
         
         And Finished 
         And Got through—
         knowing—then—
         
         
         Poem 8 (J 242: 1861/1945)
         
         When we stand on top of Things—
         And like the Trees, look down—
         The smoke all cleared away from it—
         And Mirrors on the scene—
         
         
         Just laying light—no soul will wink
         Except it have a flaw—
         The Sound ones, like the Hills
         
         —shall stand—
         —stand up—
         
         
         No Lightening, 
         scares away—
         drives away—
         
         
         
         
         The Perfect, nowhere be afraid—
         They bear their
         
         dauntless Heads,
         fearless—Heads,
         tranquil—Heads,
         
         
         Where others, dare not 
         go at Noon,
         walk at noon,
         
         
         Protected by their deeds—
         
         
         The Stars dare shine occasionally
         Upon a spotted World—
         And Suns, go surer, for their Proof, 
         As if 
         An Axle, held—
         A Muscle—held
         
         
         
         
         Poem 2. (J 607: 1862/1929)
         
         Of nearness to her Sundered Things
         The Soul has special times—
         When Dimness—looks the Oddity—
         Distinctness—easy—seems—
         
         
         The Shapes we buried, dwell about,
         Familiar, in the Rooms—
         Untarnished by the Sepulchre,
         
         
         The
         Our
          Mouldering Playmate comes—
         
         
         In just the Jacket that he wore—
         Long buttoned in the Mold
         Since we—old mornings, Children—played—
         Divided by a world—
         
         
         The Grave yields back her Robberies—
         The Years, our pilfered Things—
         Bright Knots of Apparitions
         Salute us with their wings—
         
         
         As we—it were—that perished—
         Themself—had just remained till we rejoin them—
         And 'twas they, and not ourself
         That mourned.
         
         
         Poem 3 (J 279: 1861/1896)
         
         Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord, 
         Then, I am ready to go!
         Just look at the Horses—
         Rapid! That will do!
         
         
         Put me in on the 
         firmest 
         tightest 
         highest—
         side—
         So I shall never fall—
         For we must ride to the Judgment—
         
         
         And it's partly, down Hill—
         And it's many a mile—the Hills—
         
         
         
         
         But I never mind the 
         steepest
         Bridges
         
         
         And I never mind the Sea—
         Held fast in Everlasting Race—
         By my own Choice, and Thee—
         
         
         Goodbye to the Life I used to live—
         And the World I used to know—
         And kiss the Hills, for me, just once—
         
         Then—
         Now 
         Here's a keepsake for 
          I am ready to go!
         
         
         Poem 10 (J 608: 1862/1890)
         
         Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?
         Not Death—for who is He?
         The Porter of my father's Lodge
         As much abasheth me!
         
         
         Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear thing
         That comprehendeth me
         In one or 
         two existences
         more—existences
         
         
         
         Just as the case may be
         As Deity decree—
         
         
         
         
         
         Of Resurrection? Is the East
         Afraid to trust the Morn
         With her fastidious forehead?
         As soon impeach my Crown!
         
         
         Poem 11 (J 446: 1862/1914)
         
         He showed me Hights I never saw—
         "Would'st Climb," —He said?
         I said—"Not so"—
         "With me—" He said—"With me"?
         He showed me Secrets—Morning's Nest—
         The Rope the Nights were put across—
         "And now—"Would'st have me for a Guest"?
         I could not find my "Yes".
         
         
         And then, He brake His Life—And lo,
         A Light, for me, did solemn glow,
         
         The steadier, as my face withdrew
         The larger—as my face withdrew
         
         
         And could I, further, "No"?

            <p>When we stand on top of Things—And like the Trees, look down—The smoke all cleared away from it—And Mirrors on the scene—</p>
            <p>Just laying light—no soul will winkExcept it have a flaw—The Sound ones, like the Hills
               
               —shall stand—
               —stand up—
               
               No Lightening, 
               scares away—
               drives away—
               
               
            </p>
            <p>The Perfect, nowhere be afraid—They bear their
               dauntless Heads,
               fearless—Heads,
               tranquil—Heads,
               
               Where others, dare not 
               go at Noon,
               walk at noon,
               
               Protected by their deeds—
            </p>
            <p>The Stars dare shine occasionallyUpon a spotted World—And Suns, go surer, for their Proof, As if 
               An Axle, held—
               A Muscle—held
               
               
            </p>

         <h2>Poem 2. (J 607: 1862/1929)</h2>
         <p>
            <p>Of nearness to her Sundered ThingsThe Soul has special times—When Dimness—looks the Oddity—Distinctness—easy—seems—</p>
            <p>The Shapes we buried, dwell about,Familiar, in the Rooms—Untarnished by the Sepulchre,
               
               The
               Our
                Mouldering Playmate comes—
            </p>
            <p>In just the Jacket that he wore—Long buttoned in the MoldSince we—old mornings, Children—played—Divided by a world—</p>
            <p>The Grave yields back her Robberies—The Years, our pilfered Things—Bright Knots of ApparitionsSalute us with their wings—</p>
            <p>As we—it were—that perished—Themself—had just remained till we rejoin them—And 'twas they, and not ourselfThat mourned.</p>

         <p>
            <p>Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord, Then, I am ready to go!Just look at the Horses—Rapid! That will do!</p>
            <p>Put me in on the 
               firmest 
               tightest 
               highest—
               side—So I shall never fall—For we must ride to the Judgment—
               
               And it's partly, down Hill—
               And it's many a mile—the Hills—
               
               
            </p>
            <p>But I never mind the 
               steepest
               Bridges
               
               And I never mind the Sea—Held fast in Everlasting Race—By my own Choice, and Thee—
            </p>
            <p>Goodbye to the Life I used to live—And the World I used to know—And kiss the Hills, for me, just once—
               Then—
               Now 
               Here's a keepsake for 
                I am ready to go!

         <p>
            <p>Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?Not Death—for who is He?The Porter of my father's LodgeAs much abasheth me!</p>
            <p>Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear thingThat comprehendeth meIn one or 
               two existences
               more—existences
               
               
               Just as the case may be
               As Deity decree—
               
               
            </p>
            <p>Of Resurrection? Is the EastAfraid to trust the MornWith her fastidious forehead?As soon impeach my Crown!</p>

         <p>
            <p>He showed me Hights I never saw—"Would'st Climb," —He said?I said—"Not so"—"With me—" He said—"With me"?He showed me Secrets—Morning's Nest—The Rope the Nights were put across—"And now—"Would'st have me for a Guest"?I could not find my "Yes".</p>
            <p>And then, He brake His Life—And lo,A Light, for me, did solemn glow,
               The steadier, as my face withdrew
               The larger—as my face withdrew
               
               And could I, further, "No"?
